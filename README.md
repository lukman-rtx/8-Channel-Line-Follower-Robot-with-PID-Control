# 8-Channel-Line-Follower-Robot-with-PID-Control
Line follower robot is a type of mobile robot that follows a guide line that has been made in the trajectory field. The line in question is a black line on a white surface or vice versa, there is also a track with another color with a surface that contrasts with the color of the line. The line follower robot has been equipped with a line sensor to detect the color of the line on the track plane. This robot is made using PID control to further improve the performance of the robot.

This robot is based on a project made by "Uteh Str" with a video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl5xq6wK45M&t=824s
